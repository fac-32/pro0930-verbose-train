# Feedback and Summary of Changes

Here is a summary of the recent changes for team review.

## 1. Git Workflow Documentation

* A new file `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` has been added to the root of the project.
* This file documents the recommended Git workflow for our team, including the use of a protected `main` branch, a `develop` branch for integration, and feature branches for new work.

## 2. TFL API Integration

* The `getJourney` function in `backend/services/tflservice.js` has been updated to make a live call to the TFL Journey Planner API.
* This replaces the previous placeholder implementation.

## 3. New AI-Powered Journey Summary Endpoint

A new endpoint has been created to provide AI-powered journey summaries.

* **New Endpoint:** `GET /tfl/journey-with-ai`
* **Query Parameters:** `from` and `to` (e.g., `/tfl/journey-with-ai?from=victoria&to=london%20bridge`)
* **Functionality:**
    1. Fetches journey information from the TFL API.
    2. Sends the journey data to the OpenAI API to generate a user-friendly travel summary.
    3. Returns the AI-generated summary to the user.
* **Files Changed:**
* `backend/controllers/tflController.js`: Added the `getJourneyWithAI` function.
* `backend/routes/index.js`: Added the new route for the endpoint.

These changes introduce a new feature and improve our development process documentation. Please review and provide any feedback.
