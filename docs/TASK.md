# Headline

* A server app that displays content based on a structured output
(which is a fancy way of saying, this can be anything you want, and do anything you want)

By server app I mean a web app â†’ using Node.js on the backend and vanilla Javascript for the front end.

By structured response I mean, the structured output that you receive from making you API call to open AI.

This is a time for you to be creative and have some fun with what you can build with javascript. Your code will need to be equally creative because you are working with a limited tech stack (vanilla javascript with no frameworks like React).

## Tech Stack language, repos

âž¬ Front end: Vanilla JS, no CSS libraries

ðŸ”™ Back end: Node, express

Repos: 1

ðŸ”Ž Focus

* App structure - How your folders and routes organised

* Project Management - how you keep track of tasks and peoples capacity

* GitHub Practices - protected branches (main), conventional commits, pull requests, code reviews

ðŸ“‹ Requirements

* Make and connect at least 2 API calls:
* One must be to an AI API (Iâ€™ll give you a key for Open AI responses API) â†’ responses AI
* The other must be to a non-AI API

  * For the AI API call, I would like the response to be a structured response. I will leave you to research this in your teams. IF you head to open AI documentation there is a section on structured responses.
  * A set of express routes that allow for CRUD functionality (Create(POST), Read(GET), Update(PUT/PATCH), Delete(DELETE))

* A deployed project (weâ€™ll cover this later)
  * Defined sprints and MVP
  * The following Github practises:
  * branch protection on main
  * README documentation
